Over the years, much research has been done on providing machines with the ability to detect human emotions and to develop automated emotional intelligence systems. The computer‚Äôs ability to detect human emotions is gaining popularity in creating sensitive systems such as learning environments, health care systems and real-world. Improving people‚Äôs health has been the subject of much research. This paper describes the formation as conceptual evidence of emotional acquisition and control in intelligent health settings. The authors of this paper aim for an unconventional approach with a friendly look to get emotional scenarios from the system to establish a functional, non-intrusive and emotionally-sensitive environment where users can do their normal activities naturally and see the program only when pleasant mood activating services are received. The context-sensitive system interacts with users to detect and differentiate emotions through facial expressions or speech recognition, to make music recommendations and mood color treatments with the services installed on their IoT devices.","tags":[],"title":"Smart and Context-Aware System employing Emotions Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619960400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619960400,"objectID":"8bf69d7c44bf15a2c8cd245738d0ab6f","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/talk-at-tensorflow-user-group-chennai/","publishdate":"2021-05-02T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-at-tensorflow-user-group-chennai/","section":"event","summary":"Gave a guest lecture on Computing Sentence Similarity with Siamese Neural Networks in NLP","tags":[],"title":"Talk at Tensorflow User Group Chennai","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616936400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616936400,"objectID":"aa3033b3692f6c31b70bf5b92613b53d","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/nlp-workshop-in-neures/","publishdate":"2021-03-28T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/nlp-workshop-in-neures/","section":"event","summary":"Hosted a Workshop/Session explaining on NLP Hybrid Model Development","tags":[],"title":"NLP Workshop in Neures","type":"event"},{"authors":["Harsh Sharma","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The education sectors of India as well as world are badly affected by this. It has enforced the world wide lock down creating very bad effect on the students‚Äô life. Around 32 crore learners stopped to move schools/colleges and all educational activities halted in India. The outbreak of COVID-19 has taught us that change is inevitable. It has worked as a catalyst for the educational institutions to grow and opt for platforms with technologies, which have not been used before. The education sector has been fighting to survive the crises with a different approach and digitising the challenges to wash away the threat of the pandemic.\nThe Problem The COVID-19 pandemic has had a number of consequences in different Sectors, one of which was the Education Sector.\nUnfortunately,Due to lack of physical interaction within school premisis , students and teachers had tried to adopt certain ways to address their concerns in virtual way.Whether it was traditional way of dealing with exams by faculties or students , or how students interacted with their teachers regarding their doubts , aspirations ,concerns , Virtual Distance is something which has been a major problem in this sector and not that effective as compared to physical and remote way!\nThe Solution Keeping all the conerns in our mind , we have tried to develop a smart AI Based digital Platform Using Machine Learning /AI and Web based skills to make a secure web application , which aims to analyze the user‚Äôs information,it can be a Faculty or Student.
