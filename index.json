Over the years, much research has been done on providing machines with the ability to detect human emotions and to develop automated emotional intelligence systems. The computer‚Äôs ability to detect human emotions is gaining popularity in creating sensitive systems such as learning environments, health care systems and real-world. Improving people‚Äôs health has been the subject of much research. This paper describes the formation as conceptual evidence of emotional acquisition and control in intelligent health settings. The authors of this paper aim for an unconventional approach with a friendly look to get emotional scenarios from the system to establish a functional, non-intrusive and emotionally-sensitive environment where users can do their normal activities naturally and see the program only when pleasant mood activating services are received. The context-sensitive system interacts with users to detect and differentiate emotions through facial expressions or speech recognition, to make music recommendations and mood color treatments with the services installed on their IoT devices.","tags":[],"title":"Smart and Context-Aware System employing Emotions Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619960400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619960400,"objectID":"8bf69d7c44bf15a2c8cd245738d0ab6f","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/talk-at-tensorflow-user-group-chennai/","publishdate":"2021-05-02T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-at-tensorflow-user-group-chennai/","section":"event","summary":"Gave a guest lecture on Computing Sentence Similarity with Siamese Neural Networks in NLP","tags":[],"title":"Talk at Tensorflow User Group Chennai","type":"event"},{"authors":["Harsh Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"Checkout this blog here : https://harshsharma27.medium.com/detailed-comparison-of-hybrid-deep-neural-models-and-optimizers-for-multiclass-classification-in-bd3fc1e4d114\n","date":1617062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617062400,"objectID":"d381c68c9b716b4c57d44ebb2f55c790","permalink":"https://example.com/post/hybrid_nlp_blog/","publishdate":"2021-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hybrid_nlp_blog/","section":"post","summary":"Generally, we try to find out the best suitable models, loss functions, and optimizers, which could help to obtain better accuracy by minimum loss.
