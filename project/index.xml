Conjexure utilizes the stock prices for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for training. This is primarily because the closing stock price graph for these companies over time is quite smooth overall and avoids any sudden ups or downs and follows a healthy upwards trend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ed-O-Matic - Smart AI-Digital Based Solutions for Education Analysing</title><link>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/ed-o-matic-hackthecw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/ed-o-matic-hackthecw/</guid><description>&lt;p>Abstract
The impact of pandemic COVID-19 is observed in every sector around the world. The education sectors of India as well as world are badly affected by this. It has enforced the world wide lock down creating very bad effect on the students’ life. Around 32 crore learners stopped to move schools/colleges and all educational activities halted in India. The outbreak of COVID-19 has taught us that change is inevitable. It has worked as a catalyst for the educational institutions to grow and opt for platforms with technologies, which have not been used before. The education sector has been fighting to survive the crises with a different approach and digitising the challenges to wash away the threat of the pandemic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a number of consequences in different Sectors, one of which was the Education Sector.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately,Due to lack of physical interaction within school premisis , students and teachers had tried to adopt certain ways to address their concerns in virtual way.Whether it was traditional way of dealing with exams by faculties or students , or how students interacted with their teachers regarding their doubts , aspirations ,concerns , Virtual Distance is something which has been a major problem in this sector and not that effective as compared to physical and remote way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Solution
Keeping all the conerns in our mind , we have tried to develop a smart AI Based digital Platform Using Machine Learning /AI and Web based skills to make a secure web application , which aims to analyze the user&amp;rsquo;s information,it can be a Faculty or Student. Using Appropriate Tech Stack , this app tries to analyse and solve the problem of online assignment upload, to check plagiarism of the assignments sent by the students, the teacher can check if any student had copied the assignments or not through our ML model, to give a short summary and finding the main key points in the assignment so that it could save time for the teacher and student counselling where student can predict a career or predict dropout rate using our ml model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emergency Ally</title><link>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/emergency-ally/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/emergency-ally/</guid><description>&lt;p>Built using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,Emergency Ally is a Comprehensive Web App which can help you provide SOS or Emergency Level Solutions , In Case You encounter or see someone in any Danger or Disaster Situtations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emousicolor - Smart and Context-Aware System employing Emotions Recognition</title><link>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/emousicolor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/emousicolor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Source Code For Work Described In Paper - &amp;ldquo;Smart and Context-Aware System employing Emotions Recognition&amp;rdquo;(&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15101&lt;/a>)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiclass Hybrid NLP Models Analysis</title><link>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/multiclass-hybrid-nlp-models-analysis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://harshgeek4coder.github.io/project/multiclass-hybrid-nlp-models-analysis/</guid><description>&lt;p>Detailed Comparison of Hybrid Deep Neural Models and Optimizers for Multiclass classification in NLP. Multi-class classification based on textual data refers to a supervised machine learning task, where we try to predict a certain class for input data, given the input data in raw textual format. Well, thanks to TensorFlow, we have a variety of algorithms available to perform multi-class classification via natural language processing.&lt;/p>
